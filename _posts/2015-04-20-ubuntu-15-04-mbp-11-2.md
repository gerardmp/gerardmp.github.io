title: Installing Ubuntu 15.04 on a Macbook Pro 11,2
---

In this short article I will explain how to install the latest Ubuntu 15.04 on
a Macbook Pro model 11,2 alongside MacOS X. I will use [Ubuntu
Gnome](http://ubuntugnome.org), but the process should be exactly the same for
the other flavours. Contrary to what you may think, it is a smooth process and
almost everything works out of the box.  However, a few things still need to be
configured or fixed manually. By following this guide you should end up with a
functional Ubuntu installation.

# Preliminary steps

If you do not know what is the version number of your Macbook, you can find out
following the steps described [here](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT201300).
This guide has been elaborated for the model 11,2, although some steps might be
applicable to other models.

Before installing Ubuntu you will need to free up some disk space. You can
easily do that by using *Disk Utility* on MacOS: select the hard disk, go to
*Partitions* tab, add a new partition (+), drag to change the split and select
it to be left as *Free space*. I found out that in order to resize the
partition, FileVault (i.e. disk encryption) has to be turned off. In my case I
allocated ~60GB, enough for my purposes.

After disk is resized, prepare a USB stick with Ubuntu as detailed
[here](http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop/create-a-usb-stick-on-mac-osx).

# Installation

First of all plug your USB stick, reboot, hold the <kbd>Alt</kbd> key and
select the *EFI Boot* option. After less than a minute Ubuntu will be ready.

Before proceeding with the installation I recommend you to enable the wireless
driver so that you will be able to download the latest updates during the
installation as well as download some extra stuff needed later. You can do that
by enabling the BCM4360 driver in *Software & Updates > Additional Drivers*.

The next step is to open the installer. When asked for which installation type
you want, select the option *Something else* and create something like this on
your free space:

* swap partition (min. $$\left\lceil\sqrt{\text{RAM}}\right\rceil$$, max. $$1.5
  \cdot \text{RAM}$$ - see [this](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SwapFaq))
* root partition (ext4, mount point `/`)

In my case I selected the minimum swap possible (4GB) as my Macbook SSD is only
256GB. Before continuing, select to install bootloader to the EFI partition
(`/dev/sda1`).

Once the installation is finished and before rebooting, I recommend you to
download the necessary wireless driver packages (given in the next section),
mount the partition where you have just installed Ubuntu and copy them there.
This is because you will not be able to enable the wireless *Additional driver*
like you have done during the installation!

# Post-installation steps

## Wireless

In order to get wireless card working, you will need to install
``bcmwl-kernel-source``. It can be downloaded
[here](http://packages.ubuntu.com/vivid/bcmwl-kernel-source). If you plan to do
an offline installation, download
[dkms](http://packages.ubuntu.com/vivid/dkms), too. You can then easily install
them:

{% highlight bash %}
$ sudo dpkg -i dkms_VER_ARCH.deb bcmwl-kernel-source_VER_ARCH.deb
{% endhighlight %}

## Bootloader

Grub will be the default bootloader after the install. You can still boot into
MacOS by holding the <kbd>Alt</kbd> key. However, it is better to have a MacOS
entry in Grub and, if you want, default it to MacOS (my case). Moreover, you
will notice that the Grub font is too small and, last but not least important,
you will need to pass a parameter to Linux in order to prevent occasional SSD
freezes (see [this](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/MacBookPro11-1/utopic)).
So these are the steps to configure Grub:

* Generate a new Grub font suitable for retina displays:

{% highlight bash %}
  $ sudo grub-mkfont -s 36 -o /boot/grub/DejaVuSansMono.pf2 \
    /usr/share/fonts/truetype/dejavu/DejaVuSansMono.ttf
{% endhighlight %}

*  Open `/etc/grub.d/40_custom` and append the MacOS entry (MacOS will be the
   second entry in the EFI boot order, so exiting Grub will just boot it):

{% highlight bash %}
menuentry "MacOS X" {
 exit
}
{% endhighlight %}

* Change these options in `/etc/default/grub`:

{% highlight bash %}
#GRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT=0                  # Disable hidden Grub
#GRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT_QUIET=true         # Disable hidden Grub
GRUB_TIMEOUT=5                          # [Optional] Set smaller timeout (default was 10)
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="libata.force=noncq" # Linux parameter to prevent occasional freezes
GRUB_FONT=/boot/grub/DejaVuSansMono.pf2 # Use the font we have just created
GRUB_DEFAULT=2                          # [Optional] Default to MacOS entry
{% endhighlight %}

* Update grub:

{% highlight bash %}
$ sudo update-grub
{% endhighlight %}

## Firefox

Many applications are still not adapted to retina displays. Firefox is one of
them, but fortunately it can be fixed. Open a new tab, go to `about:config` and
set the variable `layout.css.devPixelsPerPx` to `2.0`.  Although it does a
pretty good job, the toolbar icons look blurry and some UI controls do not
scale properly.

## High CPU usage by kworker

The most important issue I have found so far is the high CPU usage by
``kworker`` (i.e. Linux Kernel worker thread), which seriously affects the
battery life. Apparently this is caused by an interrupt storm on ACPI interrupt
GPE06, as described
[here](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1192856). You can verify it
by checking if interrupt GPE06 contains a high value:

{% highlight bash %}
$ grep . -r /sys/firmware/acpi/interrupts/
...
/sys/firmware/acpi/interrupts/gpe05:       0   invalid
/sys/firmware/acpi/interrupts/gpe06: 2938373   enabled <---
/sys/firmware/acpi/interrupts/gpe07:       0   enabled
...
{% endhighlight %}

A quick solution for this issue is to disable this interrupt, i.e.

{% highlight bash %}
echo disable > /sys/firmware/acpi/interrupts/gpe06
{% endhighlight %}

In order to disable it on every boot, you can add the previous line to
``/etc/rc.local``, just before ``exit 0``.

# Others

* At the time of writing, there is no driver for the webcam present in the
  Macbook Pro 11,2.
* I have tried other suggested trackpad configurations, but none of them worked
  better than the default one (which works quite well).
* Suspend/Resume works fine for me, although a few times the laptop does not
  enter sleep when I close the lid (need to do a few times...).
